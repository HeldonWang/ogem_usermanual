user manual provides a guidance to O-GEM macros.\nO-GEM is Outputs Generation via Efficient Macros which is a sas macro system including display, analysis, utility macros and also TLF generation codes. It aims to develop unique display macros for unique TLF format, so that programmers could just call display macros in respective TLF codes to generate outputs.\nO-GEM consists of two parts, the first part is TLF environment setup and the second part is output generation via TLF macros.\n\nTLF Environment Setup\nCreate METADATA used in every outputs, one metadata includes titles, footnotes, program names and output file names. The other metadata includes column headers such as displayed treatment group, BigN across TLFs.\nOutput Generation\nFor every unique TLF template, there'll be a display macro. \nOne TLF generation code could generate multiple outputs by calling a display macro multiple times.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nStandardized datasets for QC\nName of datasets (.sas7bdat) is the same as output (.rtf).\nName of variables are COL1, COL2, COL3, â€¦ (COL0 for page by value).\nLabel of variables is the same as column headers in output which will be used for reporting.\n\n\nAdherent to AZSOL \nDisplay macros are developed based on AZSOL.\nFollows AZ TABLES AND LISTINGS OUTPUT FILE FORMAT.\n\n\nFollows Program and Output Naming Conventions in AZ Oncology Programming.\n\nStructure and dependecy\nBelow is the structure and dependency of macros and also TLF generation codes (currently covers ONCO Core TLF but could also be applied to other TLF).\nMore information stored in O-GEM Index Outputs Index tab, Column O(Program name), Column P(Suffix), Column Q(Output file name) and Column R(Display macro used).\n\n\n\nFile\nLocation in Entimice\n\n\n\n\nMacros\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod/macro\n\n\nu_blank.sas\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod/macro\n\n\nu_socint.sas\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod/macro\n\n\ntlf_md.sas\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod/program\n\n\nGeneration codes of Core TLF\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod/program\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use\nThere're 3 steps,\n\nTLF Environment setup\nCopy O-GEM macros and tlf_md.sas to study reporting event folder. \nUpdate localsetup.sas which will be run before every TLF.\nConvert TOC file(the structure is one record per one TLF) to metadata named as TLF.TITLES.\n\n\nTLF generation codes(.sas) creation automatically.\nOne Step to generate every code for each TLF in TOC file and a batch run code, batch_tlf.sas.\n\n\nTLF codes modification and execution.\n  \n\n\nMore details seen how to use O-GEM.\nThe centralized O-GEM \n\nin Entimice 'root/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/prod'.\nin SharePoint O-GEM.\n\nResource\n\n\n\nItem\nDescription\nType\n\n\n\n\nO-GEM SharePoint\n\n\n\n\nO-GEM Index.xlsx\nAn index file which includes AZSOL template ID, corresponding O-GEM macros used, and names of TLF generation code.

Example localsetup.sas starting from Line 63. \nHighly recommend to define the general format used for TLF in the localsetup.sas, and create special format in the respective code. \nAny other gobal information needed. \n\n\nConvert TOC file to the metadata named as TLF.TITLES.\n\nPrepare and upload TOC file(xlsx file) Example TOC file.\n\nRequirment of TOC file\nThe structure of this excel file is one record per one TLF including titles, footnotes, program names, suffix and names of output files.\n\nThe names of column headers should be \"TITLE1, TITLE2, TITLE4, TITLE5, TITLE6, TITLE7, FOOTNOTE1-FOOTNOTE9, PROGRAM, SUFFIX, OUTFILE\", in which \"TITLE4\"(TLF numbering), \"TITLE5\" (Title), \"PROGRAM\"(Name of TLF generation code), \"SUFFIX\" (Suffix to distinguish different outputs using the same TLF generation code), \"OUTFILE\" (Name of output, rtf file and sas dataset) are mandatory. If there's \"Page by value\", please fill \"TITLE7\" with \"J=L '#byval(byvar)'\" which will be used in ODS RTF.        \n\n\n\nMethods\n\nIt could be converted via the csv metadata exported from MOSAIC via VBA.\nCopy the exported TiFo values to DXXXXXXXXXX_TiFo_MOSAIC_CONVERT.xlsm.\n\nClick the \"MOSAIC CONVERT\" button, and a new sheet named \"Index\" will be created and could be used.\n\n\n\nIt could also be manually created based on the TOC file. \n\n\n\n\nRun tlf_md.sas in the study reporting event program folder.\n\n\n\n\nTLF generation codes(.sas) automatically creation.\nOne Step to generate every code for each TLF in TOC file and a batch run code named as batch_tlf.sas.\n \nRun tlf_md.sas in the study reporting event program folder.\n\nFor those TLF covered in O-GEM (Name of TLF generation code is the same as those in Column PROGRAM in Outputs Index sheet of O-GEM index.xlsx , these programs will be copied to study folder from O-GEM centralized repository automatically serving as an example to generate Core TLF and other outputs. Below is an example.\n\nFor those TLF not covered, these programs with a same name as TOC file \"PROGRAM\" column will be created with basic information such as program header, %setup and %localsetup invoking automatically. Below is an example.\n\nA batch run program named as \"batch_tlf.sas\" could also be created. Below is an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLF codes modification and execution.\nModify TLF codes and execute batch_tlf.sas as needed. \nTips\nWhen to define the 'proc format' used in TLF and if the order of the original values shouldn't be used, please add '(notsorted)' after format name.\nFor the pop_mvar parameter in display macros, it should be generated in advance by %m_u_popn gmacro. \nNote: Mostly generated in localsetup.sas if it's not unique to one TLF.\n\n\nFor the ESCAPECHAR, recommend to use (*ESC*).\nIf any changes needed for TITLES.sas7bdat (Eg. Titles, footnotes or program names), then need to update toc_index.xlsx file and rerun tlf_md.sas with pgmgen=N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\nFor those TLFs that display macros hasn't covered currently (format is different or more modifications are needed per study specific needs), analysis macros and %m_u_report could be used to generate outputs.\nReference Files\n\nlocalsetup.sas\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/doc\nOnline link\n\n\nTOC file\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/doc\nOnline link\n\n\nDXXXXXXXXXX_TiFo_MOSAIC_CONVERT.xlsm\nroot/global_tools/oncology/o_gem/pgm/v1/tlf/doc\nOnline link\n\n\n\n"},"macros/display/display.html":{"url":"macros/display/display.html","title":"Display Macros","keywords":"","body":"Display Macros\nDisplay macros are unique to TLF format and are classified into several categories:\n\nTable macros have the prefix \"m_t\".

The trtref should be within trtpair. \n\nParameters rate_ci, rate_adj, odds, cmh controls whether or not the corresponding section will be calculated. Please refer to Parameter section for detailed description.Note that for template AZTONCEF02A, we do NOT need confidence interval for rate and thus we set the value to be N. \n\nThere are 3 sets of paraters ending with alpha,decim,missval, they control the alpha value, decimal places and display text for missing values for corresponding sections.\n\n\nOutput\nOutput Dataset\nTBN after DEBUG is fixed.

The input dataset includes variables FLG1 through FLG6, with the following conditions for each flag:\nFor FLG1: aeterm is not missing.\nFor FLG2: arel equals \"Y\".\nFor FLG3: atoxgrn is within the set (3, 4).\nFor FLG4: atoxgrn is within the set (3, 4) and arel equals \"Y\".\nFor FLG5: aeout is \"FATAL\".\nFor FLG6: aeout is \"FATAL\" and arel equals \"Y\". \n\nParameter description\n\nFor the flg_list, list the flag varibales needed and separated by spaces. Variables name must be named as FLGxx, xx means 1-6.\n\nFor the label_list, there are 6 displayed texts which separated by \"|\", and corresponding to the variable list in flg_list.\n\nThe data_order_list set to \"1|1|2|2|3|3\", means that each row of flg_list are assign to value 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, respectively. The rows with the same value will be regarded as a block, and will be separated by a blank row in *.rtf output. The sorting order is also based on the value. \n\n\nOutput\nOutput Dataset\nGenerate output datasets \"work.final2qc.sas7bdat\" and \"tlf.t_ae_sum_saf.sas7bdat\"(These two datasets are exactly the same dataset and used for QC), and \"work.final2output.sas7bdat\" (used in proc report process).\nThe dataset for QC includes variables from COL1 to COL4. COL1 is the label_list and COL2-COL6 are results for treatment groups.\nThe dataset is exact same as Example 1 since the conditions are all the same.

FASFL, RANDFL, EOTSTT, DCTREAS and TRT01PN are present as columns within the dataset. \n\nParameter description\n\nThe first analysis section: \"Subject screened\" + \"Screen failure\"\nUse sub_var_label1=label ENRLFL='Subjects screened [a]' and sub_var_label2=label ENRLFL='Subjects failures' to display row texts.\nThere's no blank row between \"Subject screened\" and \"Screen failure\" which means these 2 blocks belong to a same analysis section, then set both sub_data_ord1 and sub_data_ord2 to '1'.\nTo generate numbers without percentages only for total column ,  no_percent1 and no_percent1 need to be set as 'Y', sub_denominator1 and sub_denominator2 need to be set as null, no_grp1 and no_grp2 need to be set as 'Y'.\nSince there's no need to have any indentations or the leading row ( without any results), set n_indents1, n_indents2 as '0' and sub_leading1 and sub_leading2 as 'N'.\nsub_fmt1=N and sub_fmt2=N mean the row texts are controlled by sub_var_label1 and sub_var_label2 without any dummy rows.\n\n\n\n\nThe second analysis section: \"Subjects randomised\" + \"Subjects randomised, not treated\"\nThere's no blank row between \"Subjects randomised\" and \"Subjects randomised, not treated\" but after the first analysis section, then set both sub_data_ord3 and sub_data_ord4 to '2' (increasing 1 compared).\nno_percent3 =N and no_percent4 = N mean that percentages are needed.\nsub_denominator3=denominator_random and sub_denominator4 = denominator_random mean that the denominator of percentages is based on \"denominator_random\" dataset which should be pre-defined.\nno_grp3=N and no_grp4=N mean that results for all columns not only total column need to be generated.\n\n\n\n\nThe third analysis section: \"Subjects discontinued treatment\" + \"Reason of Subjects discontinued treatment\"\n\n\"Subjects discontinued treatment\" setting is the same as the second analysis section except that sub_denominator5 is set as \"denominator_trt_start\", because percentages should be based on the number of subjects started treatment.\n\"Reason of subjects discontinued treatment\" is different with previous analysis where the dummy rows defined by format is needed. To do this, set formatlist = format DCTREAS $DCTREAS. and sub_fmt6=Y.\n\n\nBy setting sfx = mono with the program name being \"t_ds\" in this example, the resulting output files will be named as \"t_ds_mono.sas7bdat\" and \"t_ds_mono.rtf\".\n\n\nOutput\nOutput Dataset\nGenerate output datasets \"tlf.t_ds_mono.sas7bdat\" (used for QC), and \"work.final2output.sas7bdat\" (used in proc report process).\nThe dataset for QC includes variables COL1-COL4.
